## Gigsterous

## Team

We are two recent graduates of [Czech Technical University in Prague](http://www.fel.cvut.cz/en/) and big music enthusiasts. We believe we can help musicians connect through modern technology so that they can focus on their performance, rather than struggling to find their next gig.
